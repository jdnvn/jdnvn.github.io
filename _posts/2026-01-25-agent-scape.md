When I was young, I was hopelessly addicted to an MMO game called RuneScape. I started playing RuneScape back in 2007, the era of the game that is now dubbed “2007scape” or now Old School RuneScape. I still remember the Saturdays in the wintertime, waking up early with my older brother just to hop on our family computer and kill NPCs and level up. We played so much that my dad started jokingly calling it “RuinScape, because it’s ruining your life”. Recently, RuneScape has had a revival of sorts - specifically the version that I played growing up, in the form of a new game called Old School RuneScape, essentially a fork of the game from 2007.
