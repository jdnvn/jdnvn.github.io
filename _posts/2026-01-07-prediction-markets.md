I've been seeing a lot of buzz lately about prediction markets. If you don't know what prediction markets, you might have seen the videos of dudes sitting in front of a TV, waiting for a politician to say the words "Good morning" at the beginning of the press conference and either cheering or putting their head in their hands depending on the outcome. They are likely betting from an app like Kalshi or Polymarket, which are the most popular prediction markets of today. These apps let you bet on a particular event, which comes in the form of a yes or no question. For example, you can bet, "yes" or "no", whether the Rotten Tomatoes critic score of *Avatar: Fire and Ash* will be above 70 by a certain date. There will be a price associated with each voting option that corresponds to the likelihood of that option being true at the current moment, and the price of the "yes" and "no" options will add up to $1. So if the "yes" option was priced at 20 cents, that means the "no" option would be 80 cents, meaning the market thinks there is a 20% change of the RT score being above 70 by the specified date. When the date arrives and the result is determi. Every one of the bets has a cutoff date where the result is determined and the bettors are paid out.
