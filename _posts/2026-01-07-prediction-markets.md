I've been seeing a lot of buzz lately about prediction markets. If you don't know what prediction markets, you might have seen the videos of dudes sitting in front of a TV, waiting for a politician to say the words "Good morning" at the beginning of the press conference and either cheering or putting their head in their hands depending on the outcome. They are likely betting from an app like Kalshi or Polymarket, which are the most popular prediction markets of today. These apps let you bet on a particular event, which comes in the form of a yes or no question. For example, you can bet whether the Rotten Tomatoes critic score of *Avatar: Fire and Ash* will be above 70 by December
