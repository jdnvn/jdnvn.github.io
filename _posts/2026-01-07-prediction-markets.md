You might have seen the videos lately of guys sitting in front of a TV, waiting for a politician to say the words "Good morning" at the beginning of the press conference and either cheering or putting their head in their hands, depending on the outcome. They are likely betting from an app like Kalshi or Polymarket, which are the most popular prediction markets of today. These apps let you bet on a particular event, which comes in the form of a yes or no question. For example, you can bet "yes" or "no" for whether the Rotten Tomatoes critic score of *Avatar: Fire and Ash* will be above 70 the day it comes out. There is a price associated with each voting option that corresponds to the likelihood of that option being true at the current moment; the price of the "yes" and "no" votes will add up to $1. So if the "yes" vote was priced at 20 cents, that means the "no" vote would be 80 cents, meaning the market thinks there is a 20% change of the RT score being above 70 by the specified date. Every bet has a cutoff date when the result is determined and the winning bettors are paid out. When the date arrives, those who chose correctly are paid out 1 dollar for each vote they purchased. Those who were not correct lose all of the money they bet. This means that if I bought 1 "yes" vote at 20 cents and I am correct, I will make 80 cents profit, but if I am not correct, I lose 20 cents. This is simplifying it a bit, but that's the gist.

After doing some research, I found out prediction markets are not a new thing. Political betting dates back to 1503 to predict papal and royal successions  ([source](https://users.wfu.edu/strumpks/papers/Int_Election_Betting_Formatted_FINAL_NoComments.pdf))!. In the 1980s, they were used at the University of Iowa to forecast US presidential election outcomes with [surprising accuracy](https://web.archive.org/web/20121104063806/http://tippie.uiowa.edu/iem/media/08pres.html). Why are they so accurate? The answer is money. Prediction markets force bettors to be more thoughtful about their answer because wrong bets mean financial loss. When many individuals make choices based on their best judgement, a collective wisdom emerges. Meanwhile, any noise such as uninformed bets or biases get filtered out, making the outcome more accurate than any single expert. Another reason prediction markets can be so accurate has to do with the information itself. Those who have the most accurate information about an outcome will likely bet a lot of money towards it. Due to the immense speed that information travels today, the message will soon trickle out to wider and wider groups, causing more informed bets and tipping the price/odds in the right direction.

Tech CEOs of companies like Kalshi are emphasizing the accuracy of prediction markets and calling them news sources of the future. I think there is some truth to that, especially crowdsourced information being more useful than information obtained from any given news outlet, but I am in two minds. My largest concern is that people can very easily exploit prediction markets for financial gain. A bad actor could very easily "change the future" if they have some sort of connection to what's being bet on. For example, we've seen politicians say irrelevant words at the end of a speech or abruptly end their speech early, generating bettors of these unlikely events large gains. Some would call this insider trading or market manipulation, though it seems to be perfectly allowed by the CFTC, the organization that supposedly regulates Kalshi, even though it states
