I've been seeing a lot of buzz lately about prediction markets. If you don't know what prediction markets, you might have seen the videos of dudes sitting in front of a TV, waiting for a politician to say the words "Good morning" at the beginning of the press conference and either cheering or putting their head in their hands depending on the outcome. They are likely betting from an app like Kalshi or Polymarket, which are the most popular prediction markets of today. These apps let you bet on a particular event, which comes in the form of a yes or no question. For example, you can bet "yes" or "no" for whether the Rotten Tomatoes critic score of *Avatar: Fire and Ash* will be above 70 by a certain date. There will be a price associated with each voting option that corresponds to the likelihood of that option being true at the current moment, and the price of the "yes" and "no" votes will add up to $1. So if the "yes" vote was priced at 20 cents, that means the "no" vote would be 80 cents, meaning the market thinks there is a 20% change of the RT score being above 70 by the specified date. Every one of the bets has a cutoff date where the result is determined and the correct bettors are paid out. When the date arrives, those who chose correctly are paid out 1 - (price they bought at) for each vote purchased. Those who were not correct lose all of the money they bet. This means that if I bought 1 "yes" vote at 20 cents and I am correct, I will make 80 cents profit, but if I am not correct I lose 20 cents. This is simplifying it a bit, but that's the gist.

Conceptually, this all sounds cool. It's basically a system to allow you to bet on any verifiable outcome. After researching it a bit, it turns out prediction markets are not a new thing. Political betting dates back to 1503 and even then it was considered an old practice ([source](https://users.wfu.edu/strumpks/papers/Int_Election_Betting_Formatted_FINAL_NoComments.pdf)). They have also been used internally in companies like Microsoft and Google to determine outcomes like the date of a new office opening or the budget of a project.
