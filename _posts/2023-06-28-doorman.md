# doorman, the apartment buzzer bot

I like to come up with ideas for apps or tools to build with software. I used to focus on world-changing ideas that would be the next big thing which everyone and their mothers would use, but I kept coming up short for some reason. So, I figured maybe the best way to get there would be to start small. What things in my everyday life can I make easier with technology? Recently I came up with what I think is my best idea ever.
